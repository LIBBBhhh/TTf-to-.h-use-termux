# TTf-to-.h-use-termux
hello everyone i will show you how to convert ttf font to .h. texted it on a font from the game katawa shojo. and yes, I did not insert fonts into any imgui projects, so I don’t know if this method works   
# you will need:
termux https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases





Now you don’t have to mess around with files, just run the bash script in Termux
example:
```
cd /path/to/script


sh ato.sh

```

in the sh script, be sure to edit your font name; the output does not need to be edited

### PS 
its work
